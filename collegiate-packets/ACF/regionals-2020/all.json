An analyte is placed into a capillary tube and the range of points at which this process occurs is observed in a procedure for determining sample purity. The temperature at which this endothermic process occurs is minimized in eutectic (“yoo-TEK-tik”) mixtures. The latent heat of fusion is the change in enthalpy as this phase transition occurs.
