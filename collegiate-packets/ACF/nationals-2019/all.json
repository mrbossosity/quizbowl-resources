In P. parishii, this process occurs due to a phase change from solid to liquid leading to a droplet “stepping” onto a papillate surface. This process is prevented by the interaction between the cysteine-rich protein SCR/SP11 and the transmembrane kinase SRK, which are both expressed in adjacent protein coding regions in the S-locus in Brassica. Organisms adopt “pin” and “thrum” structures as a physical barrier to this process in a form of herkogamy. Plants which only produce cleistogamous flowers must undergo this process, which can be prevented by protandry and heterostyly and cannot occur in dioecious plants.
